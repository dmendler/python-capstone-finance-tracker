# Personal Finance Tracker

Danny Mendler

This Command-Line Personal Finance Tracker allows you to manage your finances in a simple way. You can interact with this script by adding expenses (inputing a description, category, and amount), viewing all expenses organized by category, or see the spending summary of each category.

> You can easily run the script by typing in the command line:
>
>> python ./finance_tracker.py

In this project, I used many Python concepts including functions, loops, user input, error handling (try/except), and different data structures like dictionaries, lists, and tuples
